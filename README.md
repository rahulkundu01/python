Introduction to Python Class:

Classes are a way of grouping related bits of information together into a single unit (also known as an object), along with functions that can be called to manipulate that object (also known as methods). For example, if you want to track information about a person, you might want to record their name, address and phone number, and be able to manipulate all of these as a single unit.
Python has a slightly idiosyncratic way of handling classes, so even if you're familiar with object-oriented languages like C++ or Java, it's still worth digging into Python classes since there are a few things that are different.

Before we start, it's important to understand the difference between a class and an object. A class is simply a description of what things should look like, what variables will be grouped together, and what functions can be called to manipulate those variables. Using this description, Python can then create many instances of the class (or objects), which can then be manipulated independently. Think of a class as a cookie cutter - it's not a cookie itself, but it's a description of what a cookie looks like, and can be used to create many individual cookies, each of which can be eaten separately. Yum!

Defining a Python Class
Let's start off by defining a simple class:

1
2
3

class Foo:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
    def printVal(self):
        print(self.val)
The class is called Foo and as usual, we use indentation to tell Python where the class definition starts and ends. In this example, the class definition consists of two function definitions (or methods), one called __init__ and the other printVal. There is also one member variable, not explicitly defined, but we'll explain below how it gets created.


The diagram shows what the class definition looks like - 2 methods and 1 member variable. Using this definition, we can then create many instances of the class.

You can see that both methods take a parameter called self. It doesn't have to be called self but this is the Python convention and while you could call it this or me or something else, you will annoy other Python programmers who might look at your code in the future if you call it anything other than self. Because we can create many instances of a class, when a class method is called, it needs to know which instance it is working with, and that's what Python will pass in via the self parameter.

__init__ is a special method that is called whenever Python creates a new instance of the class (i.e. uses the cookie cutter to create a new cookie). In our example, it accepts one parameter (other than the mandatory self), called val, and takes a copy of it in a member variable, also called val. Unlike other languages, where variables must be defined before they are used, Python creates variables on the fly, when they are first assigned, and class member variables are no different. To differentiate between the val variable that was passed in as a parameter and the val class member variable, we prefix the latter with self. So, in the following statement:

1
self.val = val
self.val refers to the val member variable belonging to the class instance the method is being called for, while val refers to the parameter that was passed into the method.

This is all a bit confusing, so let's take a look at an example:

1
obj1 = Foo(1)
This creates an instance of our class (i.e. creates a new cookie using the cookie cutter). Python automatically calls the __init__ method for us, passing in the value we specified (1). So, we get one of these:



Let's create another one:

1
obj2 = Foo(2)
Exactly the same thing happens, except that 2 gets passed in to the __init__ method.

We now have two independent objects, with different values for the val member variable:



If we call printVal for the first object, it will print out the value of its member variable:

1
2
>>> obj1.printVal()
1
And if we call printVal for the second object, it will print out the value of its member variable:

1
2
>>> obj2.printVal()
2
Standard Python Class Methods
Python classes have many standard methods, such as __init__ which we saw above, that gets called when a new instance of the class is created. These are some of the more commonly-used ones:

__del__: Called when an instance is about to be destroyed, which lets you do any clean-up e.g. closing file handles or database connections
__repr__ and __str__: Both return a string representation of the object, but __repr__ should return a Python expression that can be used to re-create the object. The more commonly used one is __str__, which can return anything.
__cmp__: Called to compare the object with another object. Note that this is only used with Python 2.x. In Python 3.x, only rich comparison methods are used. Such as __lt__.
__lt__, __le__, __eq__, __ne__, __gt__ and __ge__: Called to compare the object with another object. These will be called if defined, otherwise Python will fall-back to using __cmp__.
__hash__: Called to calculate a hash for the object, which is used for placing objects in data structures such as sets and dictionaries.
__call__: Lets an object be "called" e.g. so that you can write things like this: obj(arg1,arg2,...).
Python also lets you define methods that let an object act like an array (so you can write things like this: obj[2] = "foo"), or like a numeric type (so you write things like this: print(obj1 + 3*obj2).

class Card:
    # Define the suits
    DIAMONDS = 1
    CLUBS = 2
    HEARTS = 3
    SPADES = 4
    SUITS = {
        CLUBS: 'Clubs',
        HEARTS: 'Hearts',
        DIAMONDS: 'Diamonds',
        SPADES: 'Spades'
    }
 
    # Define the names of special cards
    VALUES = {
        1: 'Ace',
        11: 'Jack',
        12: 'Queen',
        13: 'King'
    }
 
    def __init__(self, suit, value):
        # Save the suit and card value
        self.suit = suit
        self.value = value
 
    def __lt__(self, other):
        # Compare the card with another card
        # (return true if we are smaller, false if
        # we are larger, 0 if we are the same)
        if self.suit < other.suit:
            return True
        elif self.suit > other.suit:
            return False
 
        if self.value < other.value:
            return True
        elif self.value > other.value:
            return False
 
        return 0
 
    def __str__(self):
        # Return a string description of ourself
        if self.value in self.VALUES:
            buf = self.VALUES[self.value]
        else:
            buf = str(self.value)
        buf = buf + ' of ' + self.SUITS[self.suit]
 
        return buf
We start off by defining some class constants to represent each suit, and a lookup table that makes it easy to convert them to the name of each suit. We also define a lookup table for the names of special cards (Ace, Jack, Queen and King).

The constructor, or __init__ method, accepts two parameters, the suit and value, and stores them in member variables.

The special __cmp__ method is called whenever Python wants to compare a Card object with something else. The convention is that this method should return a negative value if the object is less-than the other object, a positive value if it is greater, or zero if they are the same. Note that the other object passed in to be compared against can be of any type but for simplicity, we assume itâ€™s also a Card object.

The special __str__ method is called whenever Python wants to print out a Card object, and so we return a human-readable representation of the card.

Here is the class in action:

1
2
3
4
5
6

8
>>> card1 = Card(Card.SPADES, 2)
>>> print(card1)
2 of Spades
>>> card2 = Card(Card.CLUBS, 12)
>>> print(card2)
Queen of Clubs
>>> print(card1 > card2)
True
Note that if we hadnâ€™t defined a custom __str__ method, Python would have come up with its own representation of the object, something like this:

1
<__main__.Card instance at 0x017CD9B8>
So, you can see why itâ€™s a good idea to always provide your own __str__ method. ðŸ™‚

Private Python Class Methods and Member Variables
In Python, methods and member variables are always public i.e. anyone can access them. This is not very good for encapsulation (the idea that class methods should be the only place where member variables can be changed, to ensure that everything remains correct and consistent), so Python has the convention that a class method or variable that starts with an underscore should be considered private. However, this is only a convention, so if you really want to start mucking around inside a class, you can, but if things break, you only have yourself to blame!

Class methods and variable names that start with two underscores are considered to be private to that class i.e. a derived class can define a similarly-named method or variable and it won't interfere with any other definitions. Again, this is simply a convention, so if you're determined to poke around in another class's private parts, you can, but this gives you some protection against conflicting names.

We can take advantage of the "everything is public" aspect of Python classes to create a simple data structure that groups several variables together (similar to C++ POD's, or Java POJO's):

1
2
3
class Person
    # An empty class definition
    pass
1
2
3
4
>>> someone = Person()
>>> someone.name = 'John Doe'
>>> someone.address = '1 High Street'
>>> someone.phone = '555-1234'
We create an empty class definition, then take advantage of the fact that Python will automatically create member variables when they are first assigned.



Python Class Inheritance
Python classes support inheritance, which lets us take a class definition and extend it. Let's create a new class that inherits (or derives) from the example in part 1:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
    def printVal(self):
        print(self.val)
 
class DerivedFoo(Foo):
    def negateVal(self):
        self.val = -self.val
This defines a class called DerivedFoo that has everything the Foo class has, and also adds a new method called negateVal. Here it is in action:

1
2
3
4
5
6
>>> obj = DerivedFoo(42)
>>> obj.printVal()
42
>>> obj.negateVal()
>>> obj.printVal()
-42
Inheritance becomes really useful when we re-define (or override) a method that is already defined in the base class:

1
2
3
class DerivedFoo2(Foo):
    def printVal(self):
        print('My value is %s' % self.val)
We can test the class as follows:

1
2
3
>>> obj2 = DerivedFoo2(42)
>>> obj2.printVal()
My value is 42
The derived class re-defines the printVal method to do something different, and it is this new version that will be used whenever printVal is called. This lets us change the behavior of the class, which is usually what we want (since if we wanted the original behavior, we would just use the original class). Note that the new version of this method calls the old version, and the call is prefixed with the name of the base class (otherwise Python would assume you're calling the new version).

Python offers several functions to help you figure out what class an object is:

isinstance checks if an object is an instance of the specified class, or a derived class.
Such as the following:

1
2
3
4
5
6
>>> print(isinstance(obj, Foo))
True
>>> print(isinstance(obj, DerivedFoo))
True
>>> print(isinstance(obj, DerivedFoo2))
False
issubclass checks if a class is derived from another class
Such as the following:

1
2
3
4
>>> print(issubclass(DerivedFoo, Foo))
True
>>> print(issubclass(int, Foo))
False
Python Class Iterators and Generators
Python's for statement will loop over anything that is iterable, which includes built-in data types such as arrays and dictionaries. For example:

1
2
3
4
5
6
>>> arr = [1,2,3]
>>> for x in arr:
...     print(x)
1
2
3
When we define our own classes, we can make them iterable, which will allow them to also work in a for loop. We do this by defining an __iter__ method, which returns an iterator (an object that keeps track of where we are in the loop), and a __next__ method that returns the next available value. Note that the syntax of the next method is different between Python 3.x and Python 2.x. For Python 3.x you must use the __next__ method, whereas for Python 2.x you must use the next method.

Here's a simple example that lets you iterate backwards over a data structure. Here's the class definition:

Python 3.x

class Backwards:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.pos = len(val)
 
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
 
    def __next__(self):
        # We're done
        if self.pos <= 0:
            raise StopIteration
 
        self.pos = self.pos - 1
        return self.val[self.pos]
And here's an example of iterating over the class:

1
2
3
4
5
>>> for x in Backwards([1,2,3]):
...     print(x)
3
2
1
The class tracks two things, the data structure being iterated over, and the next value to be returned. The __iter__ method just returns a reference to the object itself, since this is whatâ€™s being used to manage the loop. When Python loops over the object, it repeatedly calls the next method to get the next value, until a StopIteration exception is thrown when there are no more left.

This is a very simple example, but most of it is boiler-plate code (to get each item and track where we're up to in the loop) that will be the same every time we want to create an iterable class. However, Python comes to our rescue yet again and gives us a way to eliminate all of this repetitive administrative code, using generators.

A generator is a special kind of function that returns an iterable object that auto-magically remembers where it's up to in a loop. Here's the same example, done this time using a generator.

The function can be defined as follows (Note: using the yield keyword):

1
2
3
def backwards(val):
    for n in range(len(val), 0, -1):
        yield val[n-1]
Here's how we can use the generator:

1
2
3
4
5
>>> for x in backwards([1,2,3]):
...     print(x)
3
2
1
If you've never seen this kind of thing before, it can be really hard to get your head around it, but the easiest way to think of it is to read the backwards function like this:

Loop backwards over the value passed in.
On each pass, yield the next value i.e. temporarily stop executing the loop and return the next value to the caller. It does whatever it wants with it, then when it calls us again, we resume the loop from where we left off.
Python Classes as Objects
A class is a description of what instances of that class will look like i.e. what methods and member variables they will have. Internally, Python keeps track of each class definition in its own object, which we can modify. This means we can change the definition of a class on the fly, or even create a completely new class at run-time!

Let's start with a simple class definition:

1
2
3
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
Let's see the usage:

1
2
3
>>> obj = Foo(42)
>>> obj.printVal()
AttributeError: Foo instance has no attribute 'printVal'
Oops! We got an error, because the class doesn't have a printVal method.

OK, let's add one :-). We can define it as follows:

1
2
def printVal(self):
    print(self.val)
And we can add the function to the class as follows:

1
2
3
>>> Foo.printVal = printVal
>>> obj.printVal()
42
We defined a method called printVal that is stand-alone (i.e. it's defined outside of the class), but it looks like a class method (i.e. takes a self parameter). We then added it to the class definition (Foo.printVal = printVal), which then makes it available as if it had been part of the original class definition.

If we want to remove it, we can do that using the normal del statement:

1
2
3
>>> del Foo.printVal
>>> obj.printVal()
AttributeError: Foo instance has no attribute 'printVal'
To create a brand-new class at runtime, we use the type method:

1
2
3
4
5
6
>>> obj = MyNewClass()
NameError: name 'MyNewClass' is not defined
>>> MyNewClass = type('MyNewClass', (object,), dict())
>>> obj = MyNewClass()
>>> print(obj)
<__main__.MyNewClass object at 0x01D79DCC>
The second parameter to the type call is a list of classes we want to derive from, while the third parameter is a dictionary of methods and member variables that will make up the class definition (you can define them here, or add them on-the-fly as described above).
